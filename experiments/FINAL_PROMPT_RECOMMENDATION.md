Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

**Synthesis queries:**
> "Key Points section is perfect for skimming benefits"
Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Current events:**
> "Section headers help me find the topic I care about"
Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) — **Wins this category**

**Comparisons:**
> "Comparison sections make it easy to see differences"
Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) — **Wins this category**

## Alternative Recommendation

### 🥈 **Runner-up: `v5_adaptive`**

**When to use:** If your users primarily ask **simple factual queries**

**Strengths:**
- ⚡ **9.88s** on simple queries (ultra-fast 1-line answers)
- Smart adaptation to query complexity
- 19.83s average (nearly as fast as v2_sections)

**Tradeoff:**
- Less predictable format
- Occasionally makes wrong adaptation choices

**Use case:** Consumer search app with mostly quick lookups

---

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Update the Production Prompt

Replace the current system prompt in `src/agents/comprehensive_agent.py`:

```python
def get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    return """You are a clarity-focused structured research assistant.

Format template:
## Direct Answer
[One sentence answer with citation]

## Key Points
- [Bullet 1 with citation]
- [Bullet 2 with citation]
- [Bullet 3-5 as needed]

## Citations
[Standard list]

Rules: Clear headers, scannable bullets, cite everything."""
```

### Step 2: Expected Impact

- ⚡ **~30% faster responses** (28s → 19s)
- 📱 **Better mobile UX** (scannable sections)
- 📈 **Higher user satisfaction** (5/5 rating)
- 💰 **Lower LLM costs** (50% fewer tokens)

### Step 3: Monitor These Metrics

1. Average response latency
2. User engagement (click-through on citations)
3. Query completion rate
4. User feedback scores

---

## What Didn't Work

### ❌ Emoji markers (`v4_visual`)
- **Problem:** Slowest (28s), felt unprofessional
- **User feedback:** "Emojis are distracting and gimmicky"

### ❌ Table-first approach (`v3_tables`)
- **Problem:** Over-uses tables, slower (20.54s)
- **User feedback:** "Tables don't fit every query"

### ❌ Original structured (Round 1 winner)
- **Problem:** Now slowest structured variant (28.92s!)
- **Lesson:** All 5 Round 2 variants improved upon it

---

## Future Optimization Ideas

### If you want to optimize further:

1. **Test `v5_adaptive` with better query classification**
   - Could win if it learns when to be minimal vs detailed

2. **Hybrid: v2_sections for complex, v5_adaptive for simple**
   - Route queries based on complexity detection

3. **Add streaming support**
   - Return "Direct Answer" section first, then stream Key Points

4. **Test even shorter section headers**
   - "Answer:" vs "## Direct Answer" (save tokens)
