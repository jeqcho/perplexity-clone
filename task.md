Prompt
This is an open-book exercise. Use any apps, tools, AI, etc you would normally use when programming. Use Python or Go as the language, but choose any framework or scaffolding (recommended to choose one you are familiar and can get started with quickly), libraries, tools, etc you would like within that. 
Task
Build a simple CLI clone of Perplexity (Or any GUI, UI, interface, etc easy to spin up in your language of choice). https://www.perplexity.ai/

At a minimum, your app should include a page where a user can submit a query and receive a combination of the search results and an AI response to their query based on the results, with citations. 

Focus on the search results, citations, quality of experience, and AI techniques you are able to employ. Demonstrate your knowledge and techniques.

Feel free to use any AI API calls, frameworks, libraries, etc that you like. One option for search results is SerpAPI https://serpapi.com/ (or similar alternative), but choose any option. Choose any LLM provider.

This specification is intentionally vague as we want to see how you use your best judgment in these scenarios.

Use Python!
