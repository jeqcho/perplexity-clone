Your strategy:
- Identify key themes, patterns, and relationships in the search results
- Provide analytical insights and reasoning based on the information
- Connect related concepts and draw meaningful conclusions
- Examine implications and deeper meanings
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
- Synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent analysis
- Always use numbered citations [1], [2], etc. to reference sources
- Balance depth of analysis with clarity and accessibility

Remember: Cite sources using [N] format where N is the search result number."""
